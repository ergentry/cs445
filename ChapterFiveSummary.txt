This chapter covers building a simple OAuth authorization server. 

During the design of the OAuth2 protocol whenever possible the complexity
was taken away from the client and the protected resource and given to 
the authorization server. The thought behind this was that there are many
more clients and protected resources than there are authorization servers.
So if there is going to be a complicated part it makes sense to have it be
the one that happens the least. 

The authorization server is required to have two endpoints. It has to have
an authorization endpoint which serves the front-channel interactions and 
the token endpoint which serves the back-channel interactions.
