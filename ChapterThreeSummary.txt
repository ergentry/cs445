Chapter Three included building a simple OAuth Client. As mentioned 
previously because of the set up of the OAuth protocol the client is 
usually the simplest component. The client needs to use an access token
that is has been given to gain access to the protected resource. 
ChapterThreeClient.js goes about setting up the client to be sent to the 
authorization server who will then deal with getting the token from the 
protected resource owner and then returning that token to the client. 
ChapterThreeClientTwo.js deals with the concept of refresh tokens. If a 
refresh token is available to the client the refresh token can be used to 
get access to a new token without involving the protected resource owner
again. These tokens are useful for the case where something has happened to
the original token and the end user is no longer available to regrant a 
token. Actually using the token is even simpler than gaining the token and
can be done with a HTTP header that can be added to any HTTP call.
