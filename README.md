This is a project for an Internet Security undergraduate class at the
University of Nevada, Reno. The project will be closely following the 
book OAuth2 in Action by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso which was 
published in 2017 by Manning.

 PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
 Originally this code was intended to be run on local hosts and give an
 interactive example of all of these steps being taken and happening.
 However, I was unable to make the code work on my computer. Even when using
 later code that was supposed to be written by the authors. I have
 narrowed the problem down to either an issue with Buffer() being depricated
 by Node.js or something with the encoding. In the interest of completing 
 as much as this project as possible I am only including the files that I
 am modifying for each section. So even though those files indicate the
 use of local host and other node.js components they are not in this code.
 They can be found https://github.com/oauthinaction/oauth-in-action-code.git
